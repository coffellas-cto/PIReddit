I used it to motivate myself to finish Knights of the old republic, it was great.  I thought \"Hey, that felt good.  I'm going to finish another game.  On to Mirror's Edge!\"  That was a mistake.\n\nI don't get Mirror's Edge.  I found it to be an exercise in frustration.  The controls were horribly unresponsive.  The parkour was OK sometimes, but I found my self wanting the parkour from Brink (the horror!).  I didn't get pulled into the story at all, and just found the whole thing annoying.  The in game graphics were pretty cool, but other than that I found my self getting really angry playing it.\n\nI ended up uninstalling it, and I don't think I'll ever go back to it.\n\nSo what games failed to grab you despite their acclaim from the rest of the community?  What games do you not get?  Why?");
